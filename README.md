Use the churn data set. Filter out all variables except the following: VMail Plan, Intl Plan, CustServ Calls, and Churn. Set CustServ Calls to be ordinal. Allow the three predictors to be in either antecedent or consequent, but do not allow Churn to be in the antecedent.

Set the minimum antecedent support to 1%, the minimum rule confidence to 5%, and the maximum number of antecedents to 1. Use rule confidence as your evaluation measure.
